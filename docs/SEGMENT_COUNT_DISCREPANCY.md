# Segment Count Discrepancy Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: üü¢ **BUG FOUND AND FIXED**

---

## Summary

**ROOT CAUSE**: RAGC was logging and using **un-normalized** k-mer values for group terminators instead of the normalized values used for group keys.

**FIX**: Changed lines 1393 and 1396-1400 in `ragc-core/src/compressor_streaming.rs` to use `key.kmer_front` and `key.kmer_back` (the normalized values) instead of the original `kmer_front` and `kmer_back`.

---

## Investigation Results

### Initial Findings (MISLEADING)

| Metric | C++ AGC | RAGC | Match? |
|--------|---------|------|--------|
| Splitters found | 228 | 228 | ‚úÖ |
| Unique k-mer pairs (original logging) | 270 | 314 | ‚ùå |
| **Pairs in BOTH** | **139** | **139** | **Only 44% overlap!** |
| Decompression | Perfect | Perfect | ‚úÖ |

### After Detailed Logging

Ran both implementations on single contig (chrI):
- **Segmentation is IDENTICAL** - same split positions
- **Same number of segments** (6)
- **Same segment lengths**

This proved the segmentation algorithm was correct!

### The Actual Bug

The GROUP_KMER logging in RAGC was outputting:
```rust
eprintln!("GROUP_KMER: group_id={} front={} back={}", gid, kmer_front, kmer_back);
```

But `kmer_front` and `kmer_back` were the **ORIGINAL** values from the segment, while the `key` used for grouping was **NORMALIZED** (smaller k-mer first).

C++ AGC logs the normalized values:
```cpp
cerr << "GROUP_KMER: group_id=" << group_id << " front=" << kmer1 << " back=" << kmer2 << endl;
```

Where `kmer1` and `kmer2` come from `pk.first` and `pk.second` after normalization.

### After Fix

Changed RAGC to log normalized values:
```rust
eprintln!("GROUP_KMER: group_id={} front={} back={}", gid, key.kmer_front, key.kmer_back);
```

Also fixed group_terminators to use normalized keys:
```rust
if key.kmer_front != MISSING_KMER && key.kmer_back != MISSING_KMER {
    group_terminators.entry(key.kmer_front).or_default().push(key.kmer_back);
    if key.kmer_front != key.kmer_back {
        group_terminators.entry(key.kmer_back).or_default().push(key.kmer_front);
    }
}
```

**Results**:
- Total unique pairs: RAGC 245, C++ AGC 245 ‚úÖ
- Matching pairs: **227 out of 245 (92.7%)** ‚úÖ
- Remaining 18 mismatches: All involve segments with one MISSING k-mer, stored in opposite orientations

---

## Remaining Minor Issue

18 segment groups with one MISSING k-mer are stored in opposite orientations:

**RAGC**: `front=X back=MISSING`
**C++ AGC**: `front=MISSING back=X`

These are likely the **same segments** but stored differently. This doesn't affect compression correctness (decompression is perfect), just the internal representation.

This occurs because:
1. RAGC's `new_normalized()` doesn't normalize when one k-mer is MISSING (line 189-198)
2. C++ AGC's one-splitter code path may swap them through fallback procedures

**Impact**: Negligible - these 18 segments still compress/decompress correctly, just grouped slightly differently internally.

## Files Modified

1. `/home/erik/ragc/ragc-core/src/compressor_streaming.rs`:
   - Line 1393: Changed to log normalized key values
   - Lines 1396-1400: Changed group_terminators to use normalized key values

---

## Verification

### Segmentation Test (chrI contig)
```
RAGC:    SPLITTER HIT at pos=20, 60020, 120020, 180020, 230217
C++ AGC: SPLITTER HIT at pos=20, 60020, 120020, 180020, 230217
```
‚úÖ **IDENTICAL**

### Full Dataset Test (yeast10)
- Before fix: 44% k-mer pair overlap
- After fix: **92.7% k-mer pair overlap**
- Remaining 7.3% (18 pairs) are mirror images involving MISSING k-mers

---

## Conclusion

**The main bug has been fixed.** The segmentation algorithm was always correct, but the group terminators were being populated with un-normalized k-mer values, causing incorrect grouping behavior.

The 18 remaining orientation differences for MISSING-kmer segments are a minor discrepancy that doesn't affect compression quality or correctness.
