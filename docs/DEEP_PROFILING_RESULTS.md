## Memory Breakdown by Phase

### Phase 1: Splitter Determination
```
HashMap (temporary peaks): 153 MB
Final k-mer storage:        91 MB
```
- Rust's hashbrown grows by rehashing entire table
- Temporary 153 MB peak during growth
- Settles to 91 MB after deduplication

## Comparison: RAGC vs C++ AGC v3.2.1

### Memory Usage

| Component | RAGC | C++ AGC | Difference |
|-----------|------|---------|------------|
| Splitters | ~91 MB | ~150 MB (est.) | RAGC: -39% |
| Segment pipeline | ~105 MB | ~400 MB (est.) | RAGC: -74% |
| ZSTD contexts | 60 MB | ~80 MB (est.) | RAGC: -25% |
| Group buffers | 29 MB | ~100 MB (est.) | RAGC: -71% |
| Archive/Collection | 50 MB | ~100 MB (est.) | RAGC: -50% |
| Other overhead | 169 MB | ~267 MB | RAGC: -37% |
| **Total** | **504 MB** | **1097 MB** | **RAGC: -54%** |

### Why RAGC Uses Less Memory

1. **Immediate Writes via Writer Thread**
   - C++ AGC: Buffers packs in workers before batch write
   - RAGC: Writer thread receives and writes immediately via channel
   - Savings: ~200 MB

2. **Bounded Contig Queue**
   - Limits in-flight contigs to 4 per thread (24 total)
   - C++ AGC priority queue may hold more contigs
   - Savings: ~50 MB

3. **Efficient Channel Communication**
   - Bounded channel with 10 pack capacity
   - Ownership transfer via channel (zero-copy)
   - No intermediate buffering

4. **Rust's Ownership Model**
   - Explicit drop points for segment data
   - No lingering allocations
   - Deterministic memory reclamation

## Architecture Advantages

                       (ownership moves)            â†“
                       FREE IMMEDIATELY!        Write to disk
                                                    â†“
                                                Drop & FREE

                       NO BUFFERING IN WORKERS!
```

### Key Design Wins

1. **Bounded Queue Backpressure**
   - Reader blocks if queue full
   - Prevents runaway memory growth
   - Memory proportional to thread count

2. **Ownership Transfer Through Channels**
   - `send()` moves CompressedPack, doesn't copy
   - Sender frees after send
   - Receiver frees after write
   - No lingering buffers

3. **Dedicated Writer Thread**
   - Workers don't hold onto packs
   - Immediate write â†’ immediate free
   - Locks held only during write (short duration)

4. **Arc<Mutex<>> for Shared State**
   - Archive/Collection shared across threads
   - Minimal lock contention (write thread only)
   - No data duplication

---

## Allocation Hotspots

### Most Frequent Allocations

1. **49.1M calls** - `alloc::raw_vec::finish_grow` (Vec growth)
   - 48.9M from LZDiff::prepare (LZ encoding)
   - 211K from worker threads
   - Small per-allocation but very frequent

2. **887K calls** - `hashbrown::map::insert`
   - HashMap insertions during grouping
   - Expected for group management

3. **203K calls** - Segment metadata allocations
   - Creating SegmentInfo structs
   - One per segment (expected)

### Temporary Allocations

- **871,555 temporary allocations** (1.7% of total)
- Mostly from:
  - Vec growth during LZ diff encoding
  - Radix sorting in splitter determination
  - Segment data transformations

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | RAGC (6T) | C++ AGC (6T) | C++ AGC (1T) |
|--------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Wall Time** | 70.3s | 2.4s | 6.1s |
| **User Time** | 17.0s | 11.9s | 6.0s |
| **System Time** | 52.8s | 0.3s | 0.2s |
| **Peak RSS** | **504 MB** | 1097 MB | 1064 MB |
| **Page Faults** | ~70M | ~5M | ~5M |

**Note**: RAGC is slower due to:
1. High system time (52s) - suggests I/O bottleneck or allocation overhead
2. More page faults (70M vs 5M) - memory churn
3. But memory usage is **much better**!

---

## Old Baseline Analysis

The documented 205 MB C++ AGC baseline appears outdated:

1. **Possible reasons for discrepancy**:
   - Older C++ AGC version (pre-3.2.1)
   - Different parameters or dataset
   - Different system or glibc version
   - Measurement error or estimate

2. **Current reality** (measured 2025-10-23):
   - C++ AGC v3.2.1: 1064-1097 MB
   - RAGC v0.1: 504 MB
   - **RAGC uses 46-54% less memory**

---

## Remaining Optimization Opportunities

Even though RAGC now beats C++ AGC in memory, there's still room for improvement:

### 1. Reduce System Time (52s â†’ target: <10s)

High system time suggests:
- Excessive memory allocations/deallocations
- Page fault overhead (70M faults)
- Possible allocator inefficiency

**Potential fixes**:
- Try jemalloc or mimalloc allocator
- Pre-allocate Vec capacities where possible
- Reduce allocation churn in LZDiff::prepare (49M calls!)

### 2. Optimize Splitter Phase (153 MB peak â†’ 91 MB steady)

The 62 MB temporary overhead during splitter determination:
- Hashbrown rehashes entire table on growth
- Could use incremental growth strategy
- Or switch to a different HashMap implementation

**Potential fixes**:
- Pre-size HashMap with estimated capacity
- Use foldhash or another hasher
- Stream splitters to avoid HashMap entirely

### 3. Reduce LZDiff Allocations (48.9M calls)

LZ diff encoding has extreme allocation frequency:
- 48.9M calls to Vec::push (via grow_one)
- Most frequent allocation site by far

**Potential fixes**:
- Pre-allocate LZ diff buffer with reasonable capacity
- Reuse buffers across segments (thread-local)
- Profile LZDiff::prepare specifically

### 4. Investigate Page Fault Overhead

70M page faults vs C++ AGC's 5M:
- Suggests memory access patterns cause page misses
- May indicate scattered allocations

**Potential fixes**:
- Memory arena allocator for related data
- Better data locality
- Hugepages?

4. **Performance gap remains**
   - High system time (52s) needs investigation

   - LZDiff allocations (49M) are a hotspot

5. **Old 205 MB baseline is outdated**
   - Current C++ AGC v3.2.1 uses 1064-1097 MB
   - RAGC's 504 MB is now the better baseline

## Next Steps

### Immediate

3. Optimize splitter phase HashMap growth
4. Consider memory arena for related allocations

### Validation
1. Test on larger datasets
2. Profile with different thread counts
