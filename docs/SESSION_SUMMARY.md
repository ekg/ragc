# Sequential Processing Implementation - Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Goal**: Fix 30% data corruption bug by implementing C++ AGC-style sequential processing

---

## Accomplishments ✅

### 1. Root Cause Identified
- **Duplicate `seg_part_no` values** from Phase 1 buffering + Phase 4 splits
- Documented in `BUG_INVESTIGATION_CHECKLIST.md`

### 2. Solution Designed
- Complete architecture documented in `SEQUENTIAL_PROCESSING_DESIGN.md`
- Sequential processing: no pre-assigned part numbers = no duplicates

### 3. Implementation Complete
- Replaced 648 lines of phase-based code with sequential processing
- New code: ~345 lines (52% reduction)
- Builds successfully ✓

### 4. Progress on Bug Fix
- **Before**: AAB#0 = 8,584,313 bytes (30.2% data loss)
- **After**: AAB#0 = 9,522,900 bytes (22.5% data loss)
- **Improvement**: 7.7% more data recovered!
- AAA#0 still perfect: 12,309,305 bytes ✓

## Issue RESOLVED! ✅

**Root Cause**: stream_id collision in reference stream assignment

**The Bug**:
- Formula: `ref_stream_id = if gid >= 16 { Some(10000 + gid as usize) } else { None }`
- This causes collisions when `group_id >= 10000`:
  - Group 1813: delta_stream_id=1813, ref_stream_id=11813
  - Group 11813: delta_stream_id=11813 ← **COLLISION!**
- With ~13,000 unique groups, collisions occur for groups 10000-13000

**The Fix** (compressor_streaming.rs:845, 957, 959, 1266, 1267, 1414, 1519, 1581):
```rust
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
let ref_stream_id = if gid >= 16 { Some(10000 + gid as usize) } else { None };

// AFTER (FIXED):
let ref_stream_id = if gid >= 16 { Some(100000 + gid as usize) } else { None };
```

Changed offset from 10,000 to 100,000 (supports up to 100,000 unique groups).

**Verification**:
```
=== Round-Trip Verification Test ===
✓ AAA#0 SHA256 MATCHES (12,157,105 bytes)
✓ AAB#0 SHA256 MATCHES (12,147,781 bytes)
✓ Archive size: 4.6M (matches C++ AGC)
✓ PERFECT: All samples match exactly (0% data loss)
```

**Investigation Steps**:
1. ✅ Updated `self.total_segments` (finalize() now shows correct count)
2. ✅ Created round-trip SHA256 verification test (`/tmp/test_roundtrip.sh`)
3. ✅ Fixed `next_group_id` initialization bug (line 1219: was `new(0)`, now `new(self.next_group_id)`)
4. ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to track group_id and stream_id assignments
5. ✅ Proved CollectionV3 serialization works correctly (group 12920 encodes/decodes properly)
6. ✅ Identified stream_id collision: group 1813's ref (11813) collides with group 11813's delta (11813)
7. ✅ Fixed collision by changing offset from 10,000 to 100,000
8. ✅ Verified fix with round-trip SHA256 test - **100% SUCCESS!**
